IntraMaps Roam is a simple data collection application built using QGIS. IntraMaps Roam is built as a standalone fully packaged Python application with everything included. QGIS is **not** required to be installed on the client machine and only on the machine that builds Roam from source.  Pre-built binary packages will be available after the first release.
